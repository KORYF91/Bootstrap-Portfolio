# Bootstrap-Portfolio
homework#2
This assignment blends all the techniques learned from the first and adds an additional element. Using bootstrap, picking pieces of the code already pre-fabed to re-create the initail basic-portfolio. With this assigment my major road-block was costimizing the pre-determined CSS that was pulled from bootstrap. It in all honesty seems to develope into a love hate situation. I had to a lot more de-bugging on this assignment. 
I tried my best to keep to original sent in. 
I  started with laying out my rows and columns. know that all three pages were to mainly consist of three to five rows and apporximately two to three columns.  the nav bar. customizing the links and getting the background color to be correct was my first bug. 
I tried to blend as much of the bootstrap elements into the pages as I could. This created the issue of writing custom css to formatt one element would change another. I used classes to mare specific elements across the three pages. 
With the rows set and the columns in place. I added the elements in location - after viewing the document on the chrome broswer I used the inspector to make some adjustment and pin point problems. 
I ended up using the same CSS for some elements because it was code I knew would do the job as desired. 
There is a majority of HTML to these pages compaired to the original basic-portfolio we made. 
The user interface is pretty basic.
